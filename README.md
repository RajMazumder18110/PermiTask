# PermiTask

**PermiTask** is a robust permission-driven task management API designed to simplify collaborative todo management. Each user can securely create, read, update, and delete their own tasks, while also sharing specific tasks with other users through finely controlled permissions such as read or update access.

Built with flexibility in mind, PermiTask supports multiple resource types beyond todos, enabling scalable multi-tenant applications. By structuring permissions with clear organization, user, resource, and action components, PermiTask ensures secure, efficient access control and seamless collaboration.

Whether youâ€™re building simple task apps or complex workflows, PermiTask provides a solid foundation for managing permissions effortlessly.
